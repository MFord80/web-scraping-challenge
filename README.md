# web-scraping-challenge

This repository contains submission items for the 'Mission to Mars' web-scraping-challenge.

The Mission_to_Mars folder contains 2 jupyter notebooks.

The first contains the code used to conduct a html scrape of the Mars News Site.

The second contains the code used to convert the data on the Mars Weather site into a DataFrame.
This notebook also provides answers to 5 questions that were answered by analysing the Mars Weather data. It includes data visualisations where relevant.

The output folder contains a csv of the DataFrame created in the second notebook.

A final note on the dataset. An interesting observation can be made with regards to 2 outliers in the daily temperature recordings.
On the dates of 2015-06-20 and 2017-05-10 the recorded temperature was significantly higher than what would have been expected.
These dates correlate very closely (though not exactly) to the start of Martian year.
It's possible these outliers can be attributed to a human process, eg recalibration of instruments at a regular time.
It's also possible that they reflect an astronomical phenomena that synchronises with the Martian revolution of the sun.
